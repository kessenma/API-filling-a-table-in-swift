#  API filling in a table and label

using data from this api: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos, I have built the table in the screen shots below. Now I am trying to 'expand' the table so that users can view more information about the title they selected. The first screen shot below is what I have now, and The second screen shot below is what I am trying to accomplish.

Right now I think the way to get to where I want to be is by adding in a 'cocoatouch class' view controller, and adding in code to this file to alter the label field I inserted into the second view controller in the storyboard file titled 'main'. However, I am not sure what kinda code to add into this 'cocoatouch class' view controller titled 'title_details_ViewController.swift'.

### this is what I currently have: 
![current state](API_Filling_a_table/TitleDetails_CurrentState.png)
 
 ### and this is what I am trying to build: 
![goal state](API_Filling_a_table/TitleDetails_GoalState.png)
